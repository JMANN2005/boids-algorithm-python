# boids-algorithm-python

try changing these multiplyers to see how the flock of boids reacts <br>

flockSize = number of boids in the flock <br>
coodination = turn towards average angle of flock <br>
grouping = turn towards to the centre of the flock <br>
separation = avoid other boids in the flock <br>
selfVision = how far to look for other boids to avoid crashing into <br>
preditorVision = how far to look to avoid the preditor <br>
centerOfScreen = turn towards the centre of the screen to try and keep the boids mostly on the screen <br>
speed = how much the boids change speed <br>
speedTowardsAverage = how much the boids try to go towards the average speed of the flock <br>
fear = how much the boids turn away from the preditor <br>
preditorSpeed = how fast the preditor moves <br>
preditorTurning = how fast the preditor can turn <br>
