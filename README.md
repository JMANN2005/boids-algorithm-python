# boids-algorithm-python

try changing these multiplyers to see how the flock of boids reacts

flockSize = number of boids in the flock
coodination = turn towards average angle of flock
grouping = turn towards to the centre of the flock
separation = avoid other boids in the flock
selfVision = how far to look for other boids to avoid crashing into
preditorVision = how far to look to avoid the preditor
centerOfScreen = turn towards the centre of the screen to try and keep the boids mostly on the screen
speed = how much the boids change speed
speedTowardsAverage = how much the boids try to go towards the average speed of the flock
fear = how much the boids turn away from the preditor
preditorSpeed = how fast the preditor moves
preditorTurning = how fast the preditor can turn
